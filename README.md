#Are My Plants Thirsty?

Sometimes what you want to know is yesterday's weather, not the forecast. If you've been on holiday or away for a long weekend, it's useful to know if its rained recently, so you can water the garden.

This application uses open data about Bath to give you an indication of whether its rained in the last few days. It uses some historical data about the climate around Bath & North East Somerset and rainfall data captured by a local amateur weather station.

Uses [Historic weather data](https://data.bathhacked.org/Environment/Historic-Weather-August-2014-Present/xdby-kbhf) and 
[Bath Climate Summary](https://data.bathhacked.org/Environment/Bath-Climate-Summary-1981-2010-/iygs-iq2b) open data available from Bath: Hacked.

The idea came from [a tweet by Emma Truswell](https://twitter.com/EmmaTruswell/status/620826180887969792).
